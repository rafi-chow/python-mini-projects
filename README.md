# blackjack game

a simple text-based blackjack game built in python.

## project source

this project was inspired by the ["complete python 3 bootcamp" course on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) by pierian data.

i followed the structure of the milestone blackjack project from the [course github repo](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp), adapting the code to match a beginner style and adding some personal tweaks.
